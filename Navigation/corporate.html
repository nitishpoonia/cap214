    <p class="main para">Why Physical Fitness Matters<br>

    </p>
    <p class="para">A sedentary lifestyle and elevated stress levels are not uncommon in corporate executives.
        Insufficient physical
        activity leads to a decline in energy, stamina and health, which adversely affects productivity and
        performance.</p>

    <p class="para">
        Aside from reducing the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, stroke, type 2 diabetes
        and certain types of cancer, regular exercise keeps you energised and helps you carry out your daily activities
        more efficiently.<br>
    </p>

    <p class="para">Why Corporate Wellness Programs</p>

    <p class="para">
        Corporate wellness programs not only serve to improve output, but also to enhance employee loyalty. They help
        strengthen team spirit, boost confidence and workforce morale.
    </p>

    <p class="para">
